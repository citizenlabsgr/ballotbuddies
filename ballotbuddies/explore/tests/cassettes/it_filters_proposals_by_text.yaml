      to provide revenue for the provision of Police Services, the Township is permitted
      by law to seek a renewal of the expired millage. This renewal will not increase
      the millage rate that was imposed in 2023 for police services.\\n\\nShall the

      to provide funds for all lawful police services including personnel, equipment
